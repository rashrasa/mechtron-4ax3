Code pieces for the LQR of the lander

Kalman as the observer,
DARE as the controller
fall.cpp has the equations for the lander

main.cpp shoes ho to use the DARE.


Ask me if you think somehting is not right,
ask in the lecture if you not sure what to do.

Implement the lander with observer and optimal controller. The observer determines the hight with an unknown gravity, the controller ensures the speed x' is zero as we reach ground at x=0 starting at some initial hight. (note, the controller can not accelerate the lander, only break it, else you would have to turn it upside down ...)
I give you a zip file that has a Kalman and a DARE and a README file.
And in your main code (you do not modify the Kalman and the DARE) and a plot of a successful landing. Delivery And in the printout of your mail file, and the plot you generate and the plot of the the estimated gravity.
